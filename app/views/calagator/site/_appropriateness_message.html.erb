Please only add or import events that are of interest to the Portland, Oregon technical community. The more information you provide about the event, the easier it will be for people to find and choose to attend it. Events that are not likely to be suited: webinars, for-profit seminars on proprietary technologies, marketing and sales events, and startup business events without a technology element.
